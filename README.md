# Movement Considerations
For the use of this competition, movement precision and responsiveness are the top priorities.

We selected the Furitek Micro Komodo 1212 3450KV Brushless Motor due to its lightweight design and high power. The motor is high efficiency and allows control over the speed of the car. This motor will enable us to frequently change the speed and acceleration of the car, giving a high degree of control over the car. The motor's teeth pair with the GT24 Differential gear set, eliminating the need for any gear in between. Brushless motors also have numerous benefits over brushed motors, offering an increased lifespan, less maintenance, and higher efficiency with better speed control.

This motor is connected to the Furiteck Lizard Pro 30A/50A Brushless ESC, enhancing the precise speed control and regulating the power directed to the motor. This combination gives the car smooth acceleration and deceleration, as well as ensures the safety of the motor.

Steering precision is of the utmost importance for this competition. The SunFounder SG90 Micro Digital 9G Servo gives us sufficient torque for turning the wheels of our vehicle with great accuracy, granting us control over the direction of the car. The servo is also supported by the Raspberry Pi through the PWM control, allowing for quick adjustments and accurate turns with little delay. This servo rotates a range of 180 degrees at 1.6kg of torque, giving more than enough power and distance to rotate the wheels of the car. This overkill torque ensures the vehicle can turn accurately at any speed, even when the car is not moving.

This car is based on a 1/24 sized RC car, small enough to control the car comfortably around any potential obstacles. This also makes it easier to maneuver in small spaces, such as the parking lot and pillars.

# Power Considerations
The Gens Ace 2S1p 1300mAh 7.4 LiPo battery is overkill for the power supply of our car. This battery has a continuous discharge rate of 45C, delivering more than enough power for the peak demand of our electronics, including the SG90 Servo, Furitek motor, ESC, Raspberry Pi 5 and the RRC Lite Controller. The ESC, connected directly to the controller, regulates the voltage to the motor, avoiding brownouts even under full load.

This battery is connected in parallel to the ESC and the Raspberry PI expansion board. The output of the battery and the power draw of various components are all listed below.

## Power Draw
| Component | Voltage | Max Current Draw |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RRC Lite Controller | 5v | 0.5A |
| YDLidar T-mini|5v|0.3A|
| Furitek Micro Komodo Motor | 7.4V | 5A |
| Furitek Lizard Pro ESC | 8.4V | 50A |
| SG90 Servo Motor | 5v | 0.25A |
| Pi Camera | 5v | 0.25A |
| MicroSD, Leds, and Speakers | 5v | 0.2A |

 Total Power Draw
| Category | Value |
|---|---|
| Average Current Draw | 10.5A |
| Battery Output Capacity | 32.5A |
| Headroom | 22A |
